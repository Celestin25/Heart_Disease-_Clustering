# Heart_Disease-_Clustering
# Heart Disease Analysis

This repository contains a notebook that performs clustering analysis on the heart disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Analysis Steps

1. Load the heart disease dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding categorical variables.
3. Apply K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN clustering.
4. Use PCA and t-SNE to visualize the clusters.
5. Use Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify risk factors associated with heart disease.
6. Evaluate clustering performance using silhouette score and Davies-Bouldin index.
7. Compare the performance of different clustering algorithms and choose the best one.
